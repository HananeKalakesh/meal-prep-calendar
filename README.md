<h1>Your Personalized 4-Week High-Protein Meal Plan</h1>
<h2>Important Notes on Protein Amounts & Calorie Targets:</h2>

<p>This meal plan is designed to meet your target of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lunch Meals:</b> Approximately <b>650-700 calories</b> per serving, featuring a <b>200g cooked protein portion.</b></li>
<li><b>Dinner Meals:</b> Approximately <b>300 calories</b> per serving, featuring a <b>100g cooked protein portion.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Each recipe yields <b>2 servings</b>. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>"Lunch" recipes</b> will use approximately <b>500g of raw lean protein</b> for the entire recipe (250g raw per serving), yielding <b>~400g cooked protein in total.</b></li>
<li><b>"Dinner" recipes</b> will use approximately <b>250g of raw lean protein</b> for the entire recipe (125g raw per serving), yielding <b>~200g cooked protein in total.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>You will find 3 "Lunch" recipes and 3 "Dinner" recipes each week, providing 6 high-protein lunch portions and 6 moderate-protein dinner portions for your week's meal prep.</p>
<p><b>Note on "Low-Carb" and Specific Recipes:</b> While the overall plan aims for low-carb, some specific recipe names you provided (e.g., "Kafta with Potatoes," "Shrimp Orzo," "Chickpea Salad," "Quinoa Halloumi Salad," "Noodle Salad," "Bazella with Carrots," "Mediterranean Quinoa Salad," "Fettuccine Alfredo," "Lentil Salad") inherently contain higher carbohydrate ingredients.</p>
<p>For these, I have prioritized hitting the protein and calorie targets, and will explicitly mention if they are not strictly low-carb.</p>

<h2>Weekly Schedule Overview</h2>
